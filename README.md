Java programs 

== >  variable , print statement , user-input 

1. Calculate average of three numbers input by user.
   CODE --> avgOfThreeNum.java
2. Compute area and circumference of a circle, where radius is input by user.
   (Hint : area = πr² and circumference = 2πr)
   CODE --> areaOfCircle.java
3. Calculate Simple Interest, where P and N are input by user. (Set R=1.6)
   CODE --> simpleInt.java
4. Swap two integer values.
      a) Using a third variable
      b) Without using a third variable
   CODE --> swapping.java
5. Write a Java program to create a Class named “Student” to set values of FirstName
   and LastName; and display Full Name as output.
   Example :
   Input:Enter First Name: Virat
   Enter Last Name: Kohli
   Output: Your Full Name is Virat Kohli.
   CODE --> fullName.java
6. Write a Java program to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
   CODE --> arithmaticOperation.java

== >  conditional statements and operators

8. Check if a year input by user is a leap year or not.
   CODE --> leapOrNot.java
9. Check if a number input by user is a multiple of 27 or not.
   CODE --> multiplyOrNot.java
10. Depending on the age input by user, display if the user is a minor (0-17 yrs), adult
   (18-59 yrs) or a senior citizen(60+ yrs).
   CODE --> ageDistribution.java
11. Display greatest of 3 numbers input by user.
      a) Use nested if
      b) Use logical operators
    CODE --> maxFrom3Num.java
12. Input length and width of a rectangle, and determine if it is a square or not using
    ternary operator.
    CODE --> squareOrNot.java
13. Input all three angles of a triangle and display if it is a valid triangle or not.
    (Hint : sum of all angles of a triangle = 180°)
    CODE --> checkTriangle.java
14. a) Check if user input is only of one character, otherwise print “Invalid input”.
    (Hint : Use built-in method String.length() to check length of input String)
    b) In the same code, further check if that character input by user is a vowel or a
    consonant.
    CODE --> checkChar.java
15. Input cost price and selling price of a product and determine if there is profit or loss.
    Display the final amount of profit / loss.
    (Hint : Profit = SP - CP and Loss = CP - SP)
    CODE --> profitOrLoss.java
16.  Input marks of three subjects (m1, m2, m3) from the user. Display total percentage
     and based on percentage, display final grade as below :
     Perc Grade
         70 - 100 Distinction
         60 - 69 First Class
         50 - 59 Second Class
         40 - 49 Pass Class
         0 - 39 Fail
     CODE --> gradeDistribution.java
17. Check if a user input number is a two-digit, three-digit or a four-digit number.
      Example :
      Input: 3467
      Output: It is a four digit number !
    CODE --> countDigit.java

== > switch statement

18. Create a switch statement which takes any number from 1 to 7 as user input and
    prints the name of the corresponding day as the message.
       Example : User Input : 2
       Expected output : The day is Monday !
    CODE --> weekDays.java
19.  Accept the value for two numbers from the user. Provide menu options for all 5 basic
     arithmetic operations. Perform only the selected operation on those numbers.
       Example :
       Enter ‘+’ for addition.
       Enter ‘-’ for subtraction.
       Enter ‘*’ for multiplication.
       Enter ‘/’ for division.
       Enter ‘%’ for modulo.
     CODE --> arithmaticOperation.java
20. Take the designation of an employee as user input.
    Using switch case; set the following values, based on their designation.
         For Engineer => Basic = 30000 HRA = 2600 DA = 3000
         For Manager => Basic = 40000 HRA = 4600 DA = 2500
         For Clerk => Basic = 15000 HRA = 1600 DA = 1500
         Lastly; calculate and display Gross Salary.
         (Gross Salary = Basic + HRA + DA)
    CODE --> employeeDestination.java
21.  Accept any number from the user. Using switch case, write a menu driven program to
     perform any of the following operations :
         1] Display the square of the number
         2] Display the cube of the number
         3] Check if the number is even or odd
         4] Increment operation
         5] Decrement operation
     CODE --> switchOperation.java

== > looping structures

22. Print number series of natural numbers from 1 to 25, in continuous sequence.
    CODE --> printNum.java
23. Print odd number series of natural numbers 1 to n in reverse order, where n is
    user-input.
    CODE --> printOddNum.java
24. Print factorial value of any number entered by the user.
      (Hint : n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)*(n-4) * ... * 1
      Example : 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 )
         a) using while() loop
         b) using for() loop
    CODE --> findFactorial.java
25. Implement an infinite loop, through all looping structures.
      (Infinite loop is a loop which is never terminated; i.e., when the condition is always
      “true” it is never terminated.)
    CODE --> infiniteLoop.java
