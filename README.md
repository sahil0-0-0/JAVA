Java programs 

Programs about variable , print statement , user-input .
1. Calculate average of three numbers input by user.
   CODE --> avgOfThreeNum.java
2. Compute area and circumference of a circle, where radius is input by user.
   (Hint : area = πr² and circumference = 2πr)
   CODE --> areaOfCircle.java
3. Calculate Simple Interest, where P and N are input by user. (Set R=1.6)
   CODE --> simpleInt.java
4. Swap two integer values.
      a) Using a third variable
      b) Without using a third variable
   CODE --> swapping.java
5. Write a Java program to create a Class named “Student” to set values of FirstName
   and LastName; and display Full Name as output.
   Example :
   Input:Enter First Name: Virat
   Enter Last Name: Kohli
   Output: Your Full Name is Virat Kohli.
   CODE --> fullName.java
6. Write a Java program to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
   CODE --> arithmaticOperation.java
7. Check if a year input by user is a leap year or not.
   CODE --> leapOrNot.java
8. Check if a number input by user is a multiple of 27 or not.
   CODE --> multiplyOrNot.java
9. Depending on the age input by user, display if the user is a minor (0-17 yrs), adult
   (18-59 yrs) or a senior citizen(60+ yrs).
   CODE --> ageDistribution.java
10. Display greatest of 3 numbers input by user.
      a) Use nested if
      b) Use logical operators
    CODE --> maxFrom3Num.java
11. Input length and width of a rectangle, and determine if it is a square or not using
    ternary operator.
    CODE --> squareOrNot.java
12. Input all three angles of a triangle and display if it is a valid triangle or not.
    (Hint : sum of all angles of a triangle = 180°)
    CODE --> checkTriangle.java
13. a) Check if user input is only of one character, otherwise print “Invalid input”.
    (Hint : Use built-in method String.length() to check length of input String)
    b) In the same code, further check if that character input by user is a vowel or a
    consonant.
    CODE --> checkChar.java
14. Input cost price and selling price of a product and determine if there is profit or loss.
    Display the final amount of profit / loss.
    (Hint : Profit = SP - CP and Loss = CP - SP)
    CODE --> profitOrLoss.java
15.  Input marks of three subjects (m1, m2, m3) from the user. Display total percentage
     and based on percentage, display final grade as below :
     Perc Grade
         70 - 100 Distinction
         60 - 69 First Class
         50 - 59 Second Class
         40 - 49 Pass Class
         0 - 39 Fail
     CODE --> gradeDistribution.java
16. Check if a user input number is a two-digit, three-digit or a four-digit number.
      Example :
      Input: 3467
      Output: It is a four digit number !
